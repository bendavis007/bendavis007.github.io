									<h2>Fourier Analysis</h2>
									<p>July 4, 2015</p>
									
									<p>Fourier analysis is the namesake branch of mathematics first formulated by French mathematician/physicist, Joseph Fourier (1768 – 1830). With the advent of computers, Fourier analysis has become increasingly powerful by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms. Simply put, Fourier analysis looks at time series data and identifies any underlying periods of repetition therein. It does so by transforming the time domain of a signal into a frequency domain by decomposing the function into sums of simpler (e.g., trigonometric) functions.</p>
									
									<p>A notable example of this is the discovery of an 11-year solar cycle. Astronomers have kept detailed records of solar sunspot counts since the time of Galileo and the invention of the telescope just over 400 years ago. By inspection of the data, it is easy to see that number of sunspots on the Sun appears to fluctuate with time in a very periodic manner of maximum and minimum years of activity (see Figure 1).</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/sunspots_01.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 1 - </strong>Zurich sunspot relative number, tabulated over nearly 300 years.</p>
									
									<p>By inspecting Figure 1, it is easy to notice that sunspot activity is very cyclical. It is clear that the period between successive peaks (or troughs) is roughly a decade. Fourier analysis, specifically an FFT algorithm implicated with computer software, will help us elucidate the exact period of repetition for this approximately decade long cycle (see Figure 2).</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/sunspots_07.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 2 - </strong>Output graph of the results of the FFT analysis of the data in Figure 1. This reveals several prominent periods of repetition in the data, but the most robust cycle found is the 11.0385-year cycle.</p>
									
									<p>As can be seen, Fourier analysis is a powerful tool for discovering quantifiable cycles in time series data. For business analytics, one merely needs to replace the astronomical sunspot data with any metric of your business over time. From the sunspot data (Figure 1), it is clear that there is a cycle. However, cycles are not always as apparent. An FFT can help discover cycles you didn't know about in your business. Once recognized, you will have gained a marked advantage in forecasting and accounting for aspects of your business that will predictably repeat themselves.</p>

									<h2>Principal Component Analysis</h2>
									<p>July 10, 2015</p>
									
									<p>Some parameters can be intuitively thought to correlate. For example, you might expect that human height should directly correlate strongly with shoe size (i.e., taller people tend to have bigger shoe sizes and vice versa). An example of an indirect relationship could be as global temperatures rise, global ice cover decreases. Both direct and indirect relationships are essential in forecasting for future results.</p>
									
									<p>Imagine that you are looking at a large dataset and you are trying to find variables that correlate with each other (either directly or indirectly). One way to do that is to plot one variable versus another variable, two at a time until you have compared every variable against every other variable in your dataset. This brute force will achieve the desired result of finding two-parameter correlations, but if the dataset is large, this may take quite some time, require close inspection, and not reveal any information about the existence of multi-parameter correlations. For example, the Ideal Gas Law shows that the temperature of an ideal gas is related to both its volume and pressure.</p>
									
									<p>Let's take as an example dataset, the results of decathletes who participated in the 2004 Olympic and Décastar games. Figure 1 shows the results (time or distances) of each competitor in each of the ten events, plotted one at a time against every other competition.</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/F1.pdf" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 1 - </strong>Pairs plot matrix of the times or distances earned for the decathletes during the 2004 Olympic and Décastar games for all ten decathlon events.</p>
									
									<p>As shown, the study of just ten variables requires producing and analyzing 45 unique plots (ignoring identity and reciprocal plots). Inspection of Figure 1 reveals many correlations, both direct and indirect. For example, competitors that performed well in the 100 m event tended to also perform well in the 110 m hurdles event. Also, competitors who jumped the farthest in the long jump ran shorter times in the 100 m and 400 m events.</p>
									
									<p>Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical tool that we can use on this dataset to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset to its principal components. In this case, we will reduce ten dimensions of data down to two dimensions of data so that we can more easily graphically identify how the individual variables correlate linearly with each other. We can do this in both a variables factor map (see Figure 2) and an individuals factor map (see Figure 3).</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/F2.pdf" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 2 - </strong>Variables factor map between dynamic variables (in <strong>black</strong>) and additional variables (in <font color="blue">blue</font>). A vector with a direction and length represents each variable. Vectors with similar directions are more directly correlated, and the length of the vector presents the strength of correlation.</p>
									
									<p>By analyzing Figure 2, we see that the "100m" variable is nearly opposite from the "Long.jump" variable. This implies that when an athlete performs a short time when running the 100 m dash, he can jump a big distance. This is because a low value for the variables "100m," "400m," "110m.hurdle," and "1500m" means a high score: the shorter an athlete runs, the more points he scores.</p>
									
									<p>Supplementary variables are the "Rank" and "Points" earned by the competitors in the decathlon. Because winners of the decathlon are those who scored the most (or whose rank is low), these vectors point in opposite directions. The variables that are the most linked to the number of points are the variables that refer to speed events ("100m," "110m.hurdle," and "400m") and the long jump. Conversely, "Pole.vault" and "1500m" do not have a significant influence on the number of points. Competitors who perform well in these two events are not favored in the overall results of the decathlon.</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/F3.pdf" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 3 - </strong>Factor map between individual competitors. The right side indicates better all-around performance; the left side suggests poor all-around performance; the top-right quadrant indicates fast and strong competitors; the top-left quadrant indicates slow but strong competitors; the bottom-left quadrant indicates slow and weak competitors; the bottom-right quadrant indicates fast but weak competitors.</p>
									
									<p>In Figure 3, the first axis opposes athletes who are "good everywhere' like Karpov during the Olympic games between those who are "bad everywhere" like Bourguignon during the Décastar. This dimension is particularly linked to the variables of speed and long jump. The second axis opposes athletes who are strong (variables "Discus" and "Shot.put") between those who are not. As can be seen in Figure 2, the variables "Discus," "Shot.put," and "High.jump" are not much correlated to the variables "100m," "400m," "110m.hurdle, " and "Long.jump." This implies that strength is not much correlated to speed.</p>
									
									<p><strong>PCA FOR MODERN BUSINESSES</strong></p>
									
									<p>Just as in my previous blog where I mentioned that Fourier analysis could be applied to business data, the same is true with PCA (and will be for future methods I discuss in subsequent blog posts). In the case of decathlon data, we discovered that the techniques of PCA helped us to easily visualize relationships between many variables by reducing the dimensions from many to a couple. The easy to read and interpret vector plot (see Figure 2) allowed us to graphically represent which variables were directly related, indirectly related, or even mutually exclusive. When used on business data, this could easily help identify which performance categories in your business are correlated with each other.</p>
									
									<p>Additionally, if outside factors are also modeled alongside your company's performance categories, it could be determined what environmental factors (i.e., outside of your control, but potentially anticipatable) are positively or negatively influencing your business. It is important to know thyself, especially in industry. PCA allows you to truly analyze your business as a machine and how everything is connected. Most importantly, it will enable you to identify potential "Butterfly Effects," where small actions can lead to significant, seemingly unrelated results down the road. PCA helps discover those seemingly unrelated consequences and link them to their culprit causes.</p>

									<h2>Monte Carlo Method – Using Probability Theory and Computer Simulations to Model Real-world Problems (Part I)</h2>
									<p>July 30, 2015</p>
									
									<p>Some mathematical problems are describable by an analytical method, i.e., it is possible to represent them as a solvable equation. However, it is difficult (if not impossible) to describe many real-world problems as simple equations. Instead, numerical methods are necessary to arrive at an answer. One such method is named the Monte Carlo Method, named after the famed Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco.</p>
									
									<p>The Monte Carlo Method was initially developed at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for use on the Manhattan Project. Monte Carlo Methods are a general name for computer algorithms that repeat random experiments numerous times to reveal the underlying trend. For example, let's consider the probability of drawing a Royal Flush from a standard deck of 52 cards. One may use the mathematics of combinations to arrive at the correct answer by recognizing that there are four types of Royal Flushes (spades, hearts, diamonds, or clubs), and 2,598,960 different hands in a standard deck of 52 cards. Therefore, the probability of drawing a Royal Flush at random is 4 / 2,598,960 = 1 / 649,740.</p>
									
									<p>Another way of discovering this probability is by actually doing the experiment, i.e., drawing 5 cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards over and over again and record the frequency at which a Royal Flush is drawn. Obviously, this experiment would be very tedious and would need to be repeated millions of times before any sort of trend emerged. This task would not be practical for a human to perform; however, a computer is ideally suited to conduct this experiment.</p>
									
									<p>As we discovered, the exact probability of drawing a Royal Flush is 1 / 649,740. Theoretically, if the experiment was performed infinitely many times by the computer, the ratio of successful Royal Flush draws to failed Royal Flush draws would indeed be 1 / 649,740. However, repeating an experiment infinitely many times (even for a computer) is impossible, the correct answer may only be approximated. Therefore, the more times the analysis is conducted, the smaller the error will be. Because a computer can easily repeat this experiment millions or billions of times in rapid time, the error for this result can be reduced to a negligible amount.</p>
									
									<p>For example, I conducted this experiment on my personal computer (a 2008 iMac with a 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo and 4 GB of RAM) by simulating 10 billion random draws of 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards. The result I obtained was that on average, a Royal Flush was drawn once every 652,401 hands. This result is only 0.41% different from the correct answer of theoretically drawing a Royal Flush once every 649,740 hands. Even on my 7-year old computer, this experiment took only about 4.5 minutes. Newer, faster computers could potentially perform even more random draws in less time, yielding increased accuracy. In actuality, computations of this nature can reduce the error by half by quadrupling the number of samples.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Look for part II of my discussion of the Monte Carlo Method coming soon, where I will discuss using probability density functions and applying them in coordination with Monte Carlo simulations to predict outcomes for more significant, more complex problems.</strong></p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>Monte Carlo Method – Using Probability Theory and Computer Simulations to Model Real-world Problems (Part II)</h2>
									<p>August 1, 2015</p>
									
									<p>To leverage the power of the Monte Carlo Method, I will next discuss the concept of Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and how they can be used alongside Monte Carlo Methods to predict outcomes of multiple input events.</p>
									
									<p>PDFs are probably recognizable in the most general usage as the Bell Curve. You might recall a teacher grading your class on a "curve," this meant that there would be a distribution of grades in the class, with most of the students earning a "C." In this scenario, the curve is a Bell Curve; mathematically speaking, this is referred to as a normal Gaussian distribution (the most general case of PDF). This distribution is such that the most probable result is at the center point. This center point is also equivalent to the mean, median, and mode. Additionally, the distribution is symmetric on both sides of its center. This is the most basic PDF, but PDFs can appear in any shape (see Figure 1). In contrast, the rolling of a die is a uniform probability distribution where every outcome is equally likely, and any result other than a value on the die is impossible.</p>
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Plots.pdf" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Figure 1 - </strong>Sampling of PDFs with different amounts of skew across the columns (left column = negative skew, middle column = normal, right column = positive skew) and kurtosis across the rows (top row = high kurtosis, middle row = normal, and bottom row = low kurtosis). The traditional Bell Curve (normal Gaussian distribution) is in the middle row, middle column panel.</p>
									
									<p>Four factors affect how a PDF is shaped: the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. The mean is the average of the distribution, the standard deviation governs the width of the distribution, the skewness governs whether the distribution is skewed towards the left or right, and the kurtosis governs how sharp (or rounded) the peak of the distribution is. Based on these four parameters, a PDF can be used to represent most any distribution of data. For example, the lower left PDF from Figure 1 might be describing the cost that the same make, model, and year of a car has been sold for at a particular auto dealership. This would be logical if the price the vehicle sold for were represented increasing to the right across the x-axis because the steep vertical drop on the right side must be the sticker price. Because no one would voluntarily pay more than the sticker price, there is a sharp cutoff point there, and most buyers have negotiated for a cost somewhat lower than the sticker price (towards the left).</p>
									
									<p>PDFs are potent tools because once you have modeled the shape of your distribution; you can use the resulting form to predict future occurrences. This is where Monte Carlo Methods come in. Figure 1 is representing nine separate variables, each described by their single PDF, Monte Carlo Methods can aid in performing simulated random draws from all of these distributions to access what is the total likelihood of these separate events combining in a favorable (or unfavorable) result.</p>
									
									<p>For your business, if the various metrics of your business are analyzed and modeled each with their own PDF distribution, and these metrics are known to correlate to revenue predictably, then by simulating random each parameter with Monte Carlo samples, you can ultimately predict expected income with error margins. Moreover, this makes it possible to identify the metrics of your business that are performing with potential negative skews, allowing work to be focused on removing the skew and potentially turning them into positive skews.</p>
